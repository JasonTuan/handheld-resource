I noticed the pistol and TMP and a few other guns had their damage greatly increased so some enemies died in 1 hit, while some guns will have their damage decreased. The automatic sniper rifle had it's damage decreased so you have to shoot a villager about 7 times to kill them.

[Freezes All Enemies + Shooting Gallery Things + Traps Don't Work + Skip Button Mashing Boulders + More Stuff [Read Note]]
author=bungholio
description=I went through almost the entire game with this all the way up to the island, and it froze EVERY enemy. The only enemies I didn&#039;t personally check were the regenerators, the &quot;It&quot; boss, Saddler, and Dr. Salvador (but I bet they all freeze too. The only 2 enemies that didn&#039;t freeze were the 2 parasites that pop out of enemies heads (the 1 parasite that detatches from their heads freezes).
I could walk through bear traps and those explosive wires between walls and nothing would happen to me or Ashley.
I could skip scenes that made me mash buttons to run from boulders and whatever else. I also skipped the scene where the soldiers push the boulder off roof when I just got to the island. I walked past the knight armors that swing an axe at me too. But I couldn&#039;t skip the scene where you cut the rope on the boat after killing that giant lake monster, and I couldn&#039;t skip the scene at the end of the castle where I was chased by the giant Salazar statue. When I activated it too slow and started the part where the boulder was rolling after me, I turned it on and the boulder stopped. Then I didn&#039;t have to press X, Leon just ran slow and when the buttons popped up to dodge I pressed them.
It froze everything in the shooting gallery too, so you can take your time shooting everything in the head and then unfreeze everything.
It froze everything enemies threw or shot at me (hatchets, dynamite, flaming arrows, rockets).
When you first enter the castle and go through the first door, that&#039;s where the guys in red robes with the skull masks launch those giant explosive fireballs. It freezes those.
It freezes vehicles coming at you and whatever else.

Basically it freezes everything that can hurt you. The only bad effect is that it freezes doors and breakable things (wooden barrels, crates), so you&#039;ll want to turn it off or use it with the walk through walls code.

I had a shorter version of the code but it caused the "SAVE" text to flicker in some areas
and that meant having to hold L2+R2 and fast press X repeatedly.
Both the GameCube and Wii have this code and it's about time the PS2 has it as well.

Whilst using the Equipped Weapon visible codes, I noticed when you use either the Rifle or Mine Thrower scope you can see the front end of the weapon like an fps game as well as the main characters hands also during the cabin fight normally when you see Luis through your scope his red9 becomes invisible but with these codes it&#039;s still visible.
They also create graphical glitches on the inventory screen and map screen, when you use the binoculars you might also see a graphical glitch where the front end of the gun takes up all the screen which is like seeing a large black square going past a scope.

author=bungholio
description=08, 10, 20, 40, 80 - enemies only attack you from the front. If you are grab from behind, the game acts like you were grabbed from the front.

20 - game stopped when I switched certain weapons.

df - no effect, seems that buggy 20 has to be in the code?

ff - nobody attacked me, they just walked into me. Doctor Salvador will still chop your head off. The game stopped when I switched to certain weapons.
patch=1,EE,0042DAF6,extended,00000080

[Weird view effects]
author=bungholio
description=04 - thermal goggles view. Activate it with a joker command while playing or it can act weird. If you turn it on while you are doing anything other than playing and then start playing, enemies won&#039;t light up and stuff. And then if you turn it off like that the sky will be dark and everything will look darker and weird for about 5 seconds

10 - Makes many things disappear. The map outline, all your items and your character in the weapons/items box, every enemy and character, probably anything that isn&#039;t just a part of the level. When you turn it off everything resumes exactly where it was.
patch=1,EE,0042DAF7,extended,00000004

[Weird visual effects]
author=bungholio
description=00 - makes weird stuff appear on the map. In the village when you start the game, a weird black fire appears, a black rectangle appears, and a few blinking dots appear. In Waterworld the map gets a water background, which is pointless but it looks nice.

02 - removes weird map stuff, and safely disables a lot of visual effects. Heads don&#039;t explode with blood gushing out of them, the puddle that bodies disappear in doesn&#039;t appear, special items like treasure don&#039;t blink, fire is invisible, the laser for aiming with guns is gone, the flash grenade doesn&#039;t make the screen flash white, the fire doesn&#039;t appear from the incendiary grenade, no visual explosions from the hand grenade, no fog, no dust or anything from bullet impact, no electricity or smoke from enemy weapons, your head just falls off without blood or anything when it gets chopped off, anything that you can break (glass windows, boarded up windows, barrels for items) disappears, items don&#039;t appear even though they are still there, water becomes a lot darker by losing some extra part of it moving in another direction so it looks dumb, and probably more stuff missing. If you turn this off with a joker, every effect that you didn&#039;t see happen will happen at the same time, which is kind of weird to see. Throw out a bunch of grenades, blast the crap out of bunch of things with the chicago typewriter, and break a bunch of things, then turn it off and all the visual effects will happen at the same time.

[Weird visual effects 2/Weird enemy attack effects]
author=bungholio
description=01 - This might disable a few more visual effects too, but the only thing I noticed was everybody&#039;s shadow disappeared.

02 - Your character freezes in place and doesn&#039;t take any damage from being grabbed from behind. But you will be stuck in place until somebody hits you. And enemies that are behind you attempt to walk in front of you to attack. When they get in front of you they usually stand still for about 2 seconds before they attack. If they have a weapon they take a couple steps back and stand still for 1 second and then approach you and attack.

04 - exact same as 02.
08 - exact same as 02.
10 - same as 02
20 - You can&#039;t have your head chopped off by chainsaws or anything
40 - same as 02

80 - enemies don&#039;t attack you, they just step away from you a few steps and stand still. If they attempt to grab you they go through you. But if they swing a weapon at you, you will still be hit. Enemies with bazookas won&#039;t shoot you. Enemies with crossbows still shoot you. If an enemy is far enough away from you they will throw their weapon. Enemies still throw dynamite at you. I don&#039;t know how many enemies this stops, but it stops Doctor Salvador. It stops the 1st parasite type that swings a sharp bone at you. It stops the big parasite that comes out of the cult guys heads (the one that doesn&#039;t come off and looks like a worm thing). It stops the blind prisoner with the parasite on his back that can chop your head off. It might even stop many of the bosses too. It doesn&#039;t stop that fat military guy with the chaingun, he will kill you.

ff - enemies without weapons don&#039;t attack you, they just walk into you. Doctor Salvador couldn&#039;t chop my head off with his chainsaw. Any enemy that is affected by value 80 will knock your health down to 1 in 1-hit, and after that they can&#039;t damage you so you can&#039;t die. The enemies that aren&#039;t affected by value 80 (ones that throw dynamite or shoot arrows at you or whatever else few) are not affected in any way, so they can still kill you.
